# README

(1) Researcher Support Platform.html presents the python code of a simple UI as the basis for our solution to receive information from researchers on trial designs and produce an estimate of the retention rate and provide some suggestions. The objective is to extend it to have a dynamic suggestion system which requires more granualr information. Current system generate information based on simulated data. 

(2) jointplatform.html is a web interface showing the basis for a joint research platform on mental health research for both participants to reseagister their interest, researchers to get support and be matched to participants and both to be able interact. The final solution aims to provide a ML solution to match participants to researchers with the main aim of long term retention. 

(3) Participantplatform.html is a web interface showing the basis for a participant support system to receive training information, updates on the trial and enabling them provide feedback. Access to this platform will password protected in the final solution. 
prg1.jpg, prg2.jpg, and trial.jpg are used in this interface. 

html codes for web interfaces have been provided and identified by html codes.

ret_estimate-v1.ipynb provides some early preprocessing and GP implementation to estimate retention. v1 is trained on information we extracted from a few online trials. We note that (1) is using the simulated data to estimate retention and provide suggestions.
